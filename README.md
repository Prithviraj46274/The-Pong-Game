# The-Pong-Game

The Pong Game is a classic two-dimensional arcade game that simulates table tennis.
In this game, players control paddles that move vertically along the sides of the screen to hit a bouncing ball. 
The objective is to prevent the ball from passing your paddle while trying to score points against the opponent. 
This project is developed using Python and the Turtle Graphics module, making it simple, interactive, and ideal for beginners.

Add the required python libraries in your file.
Run the main file and enjoy the game.😊
